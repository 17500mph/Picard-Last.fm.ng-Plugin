Picard Last.fm.ng Plugin

About
=====

The original and the plus last.fm plugins are great. I used them a lot.
However I always felt the configuration was overly complicated and the code
a bit of a mess and how the end result came to be sometimes a mystery.

Also I wanted a rocksolid way to only get exactly one genre tag at all times 
for a complete album. Plus sometimes delviered two, when just one was 
configured and there was no way to determine a single "albumgenre".

Some of the code and especially the name lists are reused from plus. Thanks
again for your work on this... RifRaf, Lukáš Lalinský, voiceinsideyou!
